# Game Session Tracking Implementation - Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved
You noticed that even though you were using the app, no game sessions were being recorded in the `game_sessions` table in your Supabase database. The authentication was working, but gameplay analytics were missing.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### New Service Architecture
1. **GameSessionTrackingService** - Abstract interface for tracking game sessions
2. **SupabaseGameSessionTrackingService** - Concrete implementation using Supabase
3. **Integrated into existing service locator** - Registered alongside auth and other services

### Database Enhancements
1. **Extended `game_sessions` table** with new columns:
   - `difficulty` (INT) - Puzzle difficulty level  
   - `puzzle_id` (TEXT) - Which puzzle is being played
   - `grid_size` (INT) - Puzzle dimensions (8x8, 12x12, etc.)

2. **New `app_usage` table** for anonymous and authenticated usage tracking:
   - Tracks app launches, user actions, device info
   - Works for both signed-in and anonymous users
   - Captures platform and device metadata

3. **`game_analytics` view** for easy querying of aggregated data

### Code Integration Points
1. **App Launch** (`main.dart`) - Records when app starts
2. **Game Start** (`StartGameUseCase`) - Creates session record
3. **Game Progress** (`PuzzleGameSession`) - Updates session with:
   - Piece placement events (correct/incorrect)
   - Pause/resume actions
   - Score progression
   - Completion percentage
4. **Game End** (`EndGameUseCase`) - Finalizes session and updates user stats

### Dependencies Added
- `device_info_plus` - For device identification
- `package_info_plus` - For app version tracking

## 📊 What Gets Tracked Now

### Session Level Data
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "puzzle_id": "sample_puzzle_01", 
  "grid_size": 12,
  "difficulty": 12,
  "pieces_placed": 25,
  "total_pieces": 144,
  "completion_percentage": 17,
  "current_score": 150,
  "last_piece_placed": {
    "piece_id": "3_4",
    "correct": true,
    "points_earned": 15,
    "timestamp": "2025-07-22T10:05:30Z"
  },
  "last_event": {
    "type": "pause",
    "data": {"play_time_minutes": 8}
  }
}
```

### User Statistics
- Total playtime across all sessions
- Number of completed puzzles  
- High scores and completion rates
- Last played timestamp

### App Usage Analytics
- Launch events with device/platform info
- Feature usage patterns
- Anonymous user behavior tracking

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Run the Verification Script
```bash
chmod +x test_tracking.sh
./test_tracking.sh
```

### 2. Manual Testing
1. **Launch app** → Check `app_usage` table for launch record
2. **Start game** → Check `game_sessions` table for new session
3. **Place pieces** → Watch `session_data` update with piece placement
4. **Pause/resume** → Verify pause/resume events are tracked
5. **Complete puzzle** → Check completion event and `game_stats` update

### 3. Database Queries
```sql
-- Recent app usage
SELECT * FROM app_usage ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Game sessions with progress
SELECT 
  id, user_id, puzzle_id, grid_size, difficulty,
  session_data->>'pieces_placed' as pieces_placed,
  session_data->>'completion_percentage' as progress,
  session_data->>'completed' as completed,
  started_at, ended_at
FROM game_sessions 
ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- User statistics
SELECT * FROM game_stats;

-- Quick verification - should show non-zero counts
SELECT 
  'App Usage' as table_name, COUNT(*) as records
FROM app_usage 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Game Sessions', COUNT(*)
FROM game_sessions 
WHERE started_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

## 🛡️ Privacy & Performance

### Privacy Features
- **Anonymous support** - Full tracking without requiring sign-in
- **Minimal data collection** - Only game-relevant information
- **Device-based identification** - No personal data for anonymous users
- **RLS policies** - Users can only see their own data

### Performance Considerations
- **Fail-safe design** - Game continues if tracking fails
- **Non-blocking operations** - Tracking runs asynchronously
- **Error handling** - Graceful degradation on network issues
- **Efficient queries** - Indexed columns for fast lookups

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Error Handling
All tracking operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks that:
- Log errors but don't throw exceptions
- Allow game to continue normally if tracking fails
- Provide fallback behavior for offline scenarios

### Service Integration
The tracking service is registered in the service locator and automatically injected into:
- `StartGameUseCase` - Game session creation
- `EndGameUseCase` - Session finalization
- `PuzzleGameSession` - Real-time progress updates
- `main.dart` - App launch tracking

### Database Design
- **JSONB session_data** - Flexible schema for detailed tracking
- **Separate analytics table** - Optimized for anonymous usage
- **Indexed columns** - Fast queries on common filter criteria
- **View for reporting** - Easy access to computed metrics

## 🎯 Expected Immediate Results

After implementing this code, the next time you:

1. **Launch the app** → New record in `app_usage` table
2. **Start a game** → New record in `game_sessions` table with your user ID
3. **Place puzzle pieces** → `session_data` JSON updates with piece placement info
4. **Complete a puzzle** → Session marked complete, `game_stats` updated with totals

### Sample Data You Should See

**app_usage table:**
```
user_id: a6596bd7-ec3e-4906-9762-7c42fd199f83
action: "app_launch"
platform: "android" (or "linux")
timestamp: 2025-07-22 15:30:00+00
usage_data: {"action": "app_launch", "platform": "flutter"}
```

**game_sessions table:**
```
id: [session-uuid]
user_id: a6596bd7-ec3e-4906-9762-7c42fd199f83
game: "puzzle_nook"
puzzle_id: "sample_puzzle_01"
grid_size: 12
difficulty: 12
started_at: 2025-07-22 15:31:00+00
session_data: {
  "puzzle_id": "sample_puzzle_01",
  "grid_size": 12,
  "total_pieces": 144,
  "pieces_placed": 15,
  "completion_percentage": 10,
  "current_score": 75,
  "last_piece_placed": {
    "piece_id": "2_3",
    "correct": true,
    "points_earned": 15
  }
}
```

**game_stats table (after completion):**
```
user_id: a6596bd7-ec3e-4906-9762-7c42fd199f83
game: "puzzle_nook"
total_playtime: 1200
completed_puzzles: 1
last_played: 2025-07-22 15:45:00+00
```

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. **Run the test script:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x test_tracking.sh
   ./test_tracking.sh
   ```

2. **Launch your app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

3. **Play a game session** (place some pieces, maybe complete a puzzle)

4. **Check Supabase dashboard** - You should now see data in:
   - `app_usage` table
   - `game_sessions` table  
   - `game_stats` table (if you completed a puzzle)

5. **Verify with SQL:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM game_sessions WHERE user_id = 'a6596bd7-ec3e-4906-9762-7c42fd199f83';
   ```
   This should return a number > 0.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If No Records Appear:
1. Check Flutter console for tracking error messages
2. Verify Supabase connection is working (auth should still work)
3. Check RLS policies allow inserts (they should for authenticated users)
4. Ensure dependencies are installed: `flutter pub get`

### Common Issues:
1. **Build errors** - Missing dependencies → Run `flutter pub get`
2. **Device info errors** - Platform-specific code → Should be handled gracefully
3. **Network issues** - Offline usage → Tracking will resume when online
4. **Permission issues** - Database access → Check Supabase RLS policies

This implementation now provides comprehensive game session tracking that will give you valuable insights into how users interact with your puzzle game, while maintaining privacy and performance.
