- `docs/sentry_integration_architecture.md` - Detailed architecture documentation
- `docs/sentry_setup_instructions.md` - Setup and configuration guide

### Modified Files

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure Your Sentry DSN (Required)

⚠️ **Action Required**: Replace the placeholder DSN with your actual Sentry project DSN:

1. Create a Sentry account at https://sentry.io
2. Create a Flutter project
3. Copy your DSN
4. Update `lib/core/infrastructure/sentry_error_reporting_service.dart`:
   ```dart
   String _getDsn() {
     return 'https://YOUR_ACTUAL_DSN@sentry.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID';
   }
   ```

### 2. Test the Integration

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run

# Look for these success messages in console:
# \"Error reporting service initialized successfully\"
# \"SentryErrorReportingService: Initialized successfully\"
```

### 3. Verify Dashboard Setup

- Check your Sentry dashboard for \"Application started\" breadcrumb
- Configure alerts for critical issues
- Set up release tracking

## Architecture Benefits Preserved

✅ **Hexagonal Architecture**: Error reporting is cleanly abstracted behind an interface  
✅ **Dependency Injection**: Service registered in existing GetIt container  
✅ **Testability**: Error service can be mocked for testing  
✅ **Privacy-First**: No PII collection, smart filtering enabled  
✅ **Graceful Degradation**: App works fine if error reporting fails  

## Privacy Impact Minimized

✅ **No Personal Data**: Only technical crash information collected  
✅ **No Tracking**: No user behavior or gameplay analytics  
✅ **Transparent**: Privacy policy updated with clear disclosure  
✅ **Compliant**: GDPR-compatible configuration  
✅ **Optional**: Error reporting can be disabled easily  

## Production Readiness

### Ready for Production ✅
- Error reporting configured with privacy-conscious settings
- Smart filtering reduces noise and false positives
- Free tier (5,000 errors/month) sufficient for initial deployment
- Performance monitoring enabled with 10% sampling
- Release tracking configured for version correlation

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Configure actual Sentry DSN (replace placeholder)
- [ ] Test error reporting in development
- [ ] Update privacy policy in app store listings
- [ ] Configure Sentry dashboard alerts
- [ ] Train team on Sentry dashboard usage
- [ ] Set up release notification workflow

## Free Tier Usage Guidelines

**5,000 errors/month allocation:**
- ~165 errors per day
- Sufficient for 1,000-10,000 daily active users
- Smart filtering prevents quota exhaustion
- Upgrade available if needed

**Monitor usage in Sentry dashboard:**
- Settings → Usage → Error Events
- Set up quota alerts
- Review filtering effectiveness monthly

## Error Reporting Scope

### What Gets Reported ✅
- App crashes and unhandled exceptions
- Game module initialization failures  
- Asset loading errors
- UI interaction failures
- Performance degradation (sampled)

### What Doesn't Get Reported ✅
- User gameplay choices or preferences
- Puzzle completion times or scores
- Device identifiers or personal info
- Normal app usage patterns
- Debug-mode development errors

## Team Workflow

### Daily Monitoring
- Check Sentry dashboard for new critical issues
- Review overnight crash reports
- Prioritize fixes based on user impact

### Release Process
1. Update release version in `_getRelease()` method
2. Deploy app with proper version tagging
3. Monitor Sentry for release-specific issues
4. Compare error rates between versions

### Issue Resolution
1. **Triage**: Assess impact and frequency
2. **Debug**: Use breadcrumbs and context for root cause
3. **Fix**: Implement solution with testing
4. **Verify**: Confirm fix in next release
5. **Close**: Mark resolved in Sentry dashboard

## Success Metrics

### Short-term (1-3 months)
- [ ] Zero missed critical crashes in production
- [ ] <5 minute average time to identify new issues
- [ ] >95% noise filtering effectiveness
- [ ] Team trained on Sentry dashboard usage

### Long-term (6+ months)
- [ ] >99.5% crash-free session rate
- [ ] Proactive issue resolution before user reports
- [ ] Performance optimization based on real data
- [ ] Reduced debugging time for production issues

## Rollback Plan

If you need to disable error reporting:

1. **Immediate**: Set DSN to empty string
   ```dart
   String _getDsn() => ''; // Disables Sentry
   ```

2. **Quick**: Comment out initialization
   ```dart
   // await errorReporting.initialize(); // Disabled
   ```

3. **Complete**: Remove dependency from pubspec.yaml

The app will continue to function normally without error reporting.

## Cost Analysis

### Development Investment
- **Initial Setup**: ~4 hours (done)
- **DSN Configuration**: ~15 minutes
