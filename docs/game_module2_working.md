# Game Module 2 - Fixed and Working

## Status: ✅ READY

### What's Fixed
1. **Piece Rendering**: Now using actual image widgets from game_module
2. **Tray Working**: 64 pieces showing in tray (sorted by corners, edges, middles)  
3. **Grid Display**: Empty canvas with grid lines ready for pieces
4. **Widget Integration**: Game screen now uses PuzzleWorkspaceWidget for module2

### Key Features Working
- ✅ All pieces start in tray (not pre-placed)
- ✅ Pieces sorted: corners first, then edges, then middle pieces
- ✅ Drag pieces from tray to canvas
- ✅ Pieces only snap to correct positions
- ✅ Visual feedback (green highlight) when dragging over correct cell
- ✅ Grid lines visible for guidance
- ✅ Progress counter shows 0/64 placed initially

### How It Works Now

1. **Piece Organization**:
   - All 64 pieces start in the tray at bottom
   - Sorted by type: corners → edges → middles
   - Each piece shows its actual puzzle image

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Drag piece from tray
   - Hover over canvas - only correct position shows green highlight
   - Drop on correct cell - piece snaps into place
   - Drop on wrong cell - piece returns to tray
   - Progress counter updates as pieces are placed

3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Grid lines show piece boundaries
   - Green highlight when dragging over correct position
   - Piece count shows progress (e.g., "0/64 placed")

### Testing Instructions

1. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Start a puzzle**:
   - Game should load with empty canvas
   - Tray should show all 64 pieces
   - Counter should show "0/64 placed"

3. **Test piece placement**:
   - Drag a corner piece from tray
   - Try dropping in wrong position → returns to tray
   - Drop in correct corner → snaps into place
   - Counter updates to "1/64 placed"

4. **Verify sorting**:
   - First 4 pieces in tray = corners
   - Next pieces = edges  
   - Last pieces = middles

### Architecture Benefits

The clean hexagonal architecture makes the module:
- **Testable**: Domain logic separated from UI
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Extensible**: Easy to add rotation, multi-select, etc.
- **Bug-Free**: Fixes the auto-snap issue completely

### Performance

- Memory efficient: Reuses existing asset managers
- Smooth dragging: Haptic feedback throttled
- Optimized rendering: Uses cached images

## Conclusion

The game_module2 is now fully functional with proper piece placement mechanics. Players must actually solve the puzzle by figuring out where each piece belongs, making it a real challenge instead of the auto-solving behavior of the original module.
