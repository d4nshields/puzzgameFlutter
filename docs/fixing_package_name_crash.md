# Fixing App Crash - Package Name Update

I've identified and fixed the issue with your app crashing. The problem was due to a mismatch between the application ID (`org.shields.nook`) and the package where the `MainActivity` class was located (`com.example.puzzgame_flutter`).

## Changes Made:

1. Created a new package structure (`org/shields/nook/`) that matches your application ID
2. Added a new `MainActivity.kt` file in the correct package
3. Updated the `AndroidManifest.xml` to explicitly specify the activity class
4. Fixed the `build.gradle.kts` file to ensure proper compilation

## Steps to Rebuild and Upload Your App:

1. **Clean the project**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/daniel/work/puzzgameFlutter
   flutter clean
   ```

2. **Get dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Build a new AAB file**:
   ```bash
   flutter build appbundle
   ```

4. **Test locally first (recommended)**:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   flutter install
   ```

5. **Upload the new AAB to Google Play Console**:
   - The new AAB will be located at: `/home/daniel/work/puzzgameFlutter/build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
   - Upload this new file to the Internal Testing track in Google Play Console
   - Create a new release if needed
   - Include release notes mentioning that you fixed the crash issue

## If You Still Experience Issues:

If the app still crashes after these changes, try these additional troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Flutter version**:
   ```bash
   flutter --version
   ```
   Make sure you're on a stable release.

2. **Review the App ID in other files**:
   - Double-check if there are any references to the old package name in other files

3. **Full rebuild with debug information**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build appbundle --verbose
   ```

4. **Review the latest logs** after installing the new version

## Why This Happened:

When you change the application ID in build.gradle.kts, Android expects to find the MainActivity class in a package that matches that ID. Since Flutter's default structure puts the MainActivity class in a package matching the original application ID, we needed to create a new class in the correct location.
