## Design Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
Information and complexity revealed only as needed, preventing overwhelming new users while providing depth for experienced players.

### 2. Immediate Feedback
Every user action receives instant response (< 16ms) through visual, haptic, and audio channels.

### 3. Forgiving Interactions
Errors are reframed as learning opportunities with progressive assistance that never punishes, always guides.

### 4. Coherent Physics
Consistent physical metaphors throughout create predictable, learnable behaviors.

### 5. Delightful Details
Celebrations and rewards at every scale, from tiny successes to major achievements.

- Flutter widgets for UI (proven, accessible)
- CustomPaint for game board (performance)
- Flame for effects (particle systems)
**Trade-offs**: Complexity vs. optimal performance per layer

### Decision: Event-Sourced State
**Choice**: Store all game actions as events
**Rationale**:
- Perfect undo/redo
- Replay capability
- Time-travel debugging
- Analytics gold mine
**Trade-offs**: Memory usage vs. features

### Decision: Client-Side ML
**Choice**: TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference
**Rationale**:
- Privacy (no data leaves device)
- No latency
- Works offline
- No server costs
**Trade-offs**: Model size vs. capability
