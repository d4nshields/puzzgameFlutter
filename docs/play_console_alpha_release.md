# Google Play Console Alpha Release Guide

This guide walks you through the process of setting up a Google Play Console account and publishing your Nook app as an alpha release.

## 1. Create a Google Play Developer Account

Before you can publish your app, you need a Google Play Developer account:

1. Go to the [Google Play Developer Console](https://play.google.com/console/signup)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Pay the one-time $25 registration fee
4. Complete the account details and developer agreement

## 2. Create a New App

Once your account is set up:

1. Click "Create app" in the console
2. Select a default language
3. Enter "Nook" as the app name
4. Specify whether it's a game or application (select "Game")
5. Specify whether it's free or paid (select "Free")
6. Confirm you comply with developer policies and click "Create app"

## 3. Set Up Your Store Listing

Complete the required information in the "Store presence" > "Store listing" section:

### Required Information:
- **Short description** (80 characters max): A concise description of your game
- **Full description** (4000 characters max): Detailed information about your game
- **Graphics assets**:
  - App icon (which you already have)
  - Feature graphic (1024x500)
  - At least 2 screenshots
- **Categorization**:
  - App category (e.g., Puzzle, Casual)
  - Content rating

  - Privacy policy URL (host your privacy policy online)

## 4. Complete Content Rating

1. Go to "Content rating" in the sidebar
2. Fill out the questionnaire about your app's content
3. Submit for rating
4. Your game will likely be rated for Everyone since it doesn't contain sensitive content

## 5. Set Up Pricing & Distribution

1. Go to "Pricing & distribution"
2. Select countries where your app will be available
3. For alpha testing, you can limit this to your own country
4. Confirm compliance with export laws and US sanctions

## 6. Create an Alpha Release

1. Go to "Testing" > "Internal testing" (or "Closed testing" for slightly larger groups)
2. Click "Create new release"
3. Upload your AAB file (created following the build instructions)
4. Add release notes describing what testers should focus on
5. Save and review the release

## 7. Manage Alpha Testers

For internal testing:
1. Create an email list of testers
2. Add their Google account emails
3. Testers will receive an invitation link

For closed testing:
1. Create a new track
2. Manage testers via email lists
3. You can add up to 100 testers to closed testing

## 8. Submit for Review

1. After completing all required information, click "Submit for review"
2. Alpha releases typically go through a streamlined review process
3. Approval usually takes 1-3 days

## 9. After Approval

Once approved:
1. Your testers will receive an email with installation instructions
2. Gather feedback using your preferred method (email, form, etc.)
3. Update your app based on feedback
4. Create new alpha releases as needed

## Important Notes

- **Alpha releases are not publicly visible** on the Play Store
- Only invited testers can access and install your app
- Test thoroughly before moving to beta or production
- The review process is typically less stringent for alpha releases, but your app still needs to comply with Google Play policies
