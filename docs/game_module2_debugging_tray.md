# Game Module 2 - Debugging Empty Tray Issue

## Problem
When the game starts, all pieces appear to be in their solved positions instead of in the tray waiting to be placed.

## Expected Behavior
1. All pieces should start in the tray at the bottom
2. Tray should show pieces sorted by: corners first, then edges, then middle pieces
3. Canvas should be empty with grid lines visible
4. Player drags pieces from tray to canvas to solve puzzle

## Debug Points Added

### 1. Session Initialization (`puzzle_game_module2.dart`)
```dart
print('=== INITIALIZING GAME SESSION ===');
print('Workspace pieces count: ${workspace.pieces.length}');
print('Pieces in tray: ${workspace.pieces.where((p) => p.isInTray).length}');
print('Pieces placed: ${workspace.pieces.where((p) => p.isPlaced).length}');
```

### 2. Widget Initialization (`puzzle_workspace_widget.dart`)
```dart
print('=== INITIALIZING WORKSPACE WIDGET ===');
print('Total pieces: ${widget.gameSession.totalPieces}');
print('Tray pieces: ${widget.gameSession.trayPieces.length}');
print('Placed pieces: ${widget.gameSession.placedPieces.length}');
print('Workspace pieces: ${widget.gameSession.workspacePieces.length}');
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Game Screen
- Added import for `PuzzleGameSession2` and `PuzzleWorkspaceWidget`
- Added check for `PuzzleGameSession2` to use new widget
- Added `_buildPuzzleInfo2` method with piece count display

### 2. Added Piece Sorting
- Added `PieceType` enum (corner, edge, middle)
- Added `getPieceType` method to determine piece type
- Added `sortedTrayPieces` getter for sorted tray display

### 3. Fixed Visual Issues
- Made empty drop zones invisible until dragging
- Grid lines remain visible for guidance

## What to Check

Run the app with debug output and verify:

1. **Console Output**: 
   - How many pieces are in tray vs placed?
   - Are pieces correctly initialized with `isInTray = true`?

2. **Visual Check**:
   - Is the canvas showing placed pieces or just grid lines?
   - Is the tray showing the correct number of pieces?
   - Are pieces sorted correctly (corners, edges, middles)?

## Potential Issues

### Issue 1: Pieces Not in Tray
If console shows 0 pieces in tray:
- Check `PuzzlePiece` initialization - should have `_currentPosition = null`
- Check `isInTray` getter - returns `_currentPosition == null`

### Issue 2: Visual Confusion
If pieces are in tray but look placed:
- Grid lines might be too prominent
- Empty cells might have visible borders
- Check if placed pieces list is being rendered

### Issue 3: Wrong Widget Used
If old widget still being used:
- Verify service locator is using `PuzzleGameModule2`
- Check that `PuzzleGameSession2` is being created
- Ensure game screen detects `PuzzleGameSession2` correctly

## Next Steps

1. Run app and check console output
2. Based on output, determine if issue is:
   - Domain logic (pieces not in tray)
   - Visual rendering (pieces in tray but displayed wrong)
   - Widget selection (wrong widget being used)
3. Fix the specific issue identified

## Test Commands

```bash
# Clean build
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Run with verbose output
flutter run --verbose

# Watch console for debug messages
```
