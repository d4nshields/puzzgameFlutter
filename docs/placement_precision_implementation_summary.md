- Default setting: 0.0 (maintains current easy behavior)

### 2. Game Session Enhancements ✅
- Added `tryPlacePieceAtPosition()` method for precision-based placement
- Added `PlacementResult` enum with success/incorrect/alreadyPlaced states
- Added `IncorrectlyPlacedPiece` class to track misplaced pieces
- Added `removeIncorrectPiece()` method for piece retrieval
- Added precision-based tolerance calculation
- Added scoring bonuses for higher precision settings

### 3. Enhanced Game Widget Updates ✅
- Updated drag/drop handling to use position-based placement
- Added visual feedback with red outlines for incorrect pieces
- Added audio feedback for correct/incorrect placements
- Added haptic feedback for placement results
- Added ability to tap and remove incorrectly placed pieces

### 4. Settings UI Enhancement ✅
- Added placement precision slider (0-100% in 10% increments)
- Added visual precision level descriptions
- Added helpful explanatory text for each difficulty level
- Added reactive state management with providers
- Added visual indicators and color coding

### 5. Architectural Components ✅
- Added `PlacementPrecisionNotifier` for reactive state management
- Added `placementPrecisionProvider` for app-wide access
- Enhanced coordinate mapping for canvas-based placement
- Added tolerance zone calculations based on piece size
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing placement logic

## Key Features

### Difficulty Levels
1. **Drop Anywhere (0.0-0.1)**: Current behavior - pieces auto-snap
2. **Forgiving (0.1-0.3)**: Large tolerance zones around correct positions
3. **Moderate (0.3-0.6)**: Medium tolerance zones
4. **Precise (0.6-0.9)**: Small tolerance zones
5. **Exact Placement (0.9-1.0)**: Very precise placement required

### Visual Feedback
- **Blue highlight**: Valid drop zone during drag
- **Red outline**: Incorrectly placed pieces
- **Tap to remove**: Incorrectly placed pieces return to tray
- **Progress indication**: Shows correctly vs incorrectly placed pieces

### Audio/Haptic Feedback
- **Success sound**: Correct piece placement
- **Error sound**: Incorrect piece placement
- **Light haptic**: Success feedback
- **Medium haptic**: Error feedback
- **UI click**: Piece removal

### Scoring System
- **Base points**: 10 × difficulty level
- **Precision bonus**: Up to 5 extra points for high precision
- **Time multiplier**: Faster completion = higher scores

## Technical Implementation

### Precision Calculation Algorithm
```dart
bool _isPlacementCorrect(piece, dropPosition, canvasSize, precisionSetting) {
  final correctPosition = _calculateCorrectPosition(piece, canvasSize);
  
  if (precisionSetting <= 0.0) return true; // Drop anywhere
  
  final pieceSize = canvasSize.width / gridSize;
  final maxTolerance = pieceSize * 0.5;     // 50% of piece size
  final minTolerance = pieceSize * 0.05;    // 5% of piece size
  final tolerance = maxTolerance - (precisionSetting * (maxTolerance - minTolerance));
  
  final distance = (dropPosition - correctPosition).distance;
  return distance <= tolerance;
}
```

### Coordinate Mapping
- Converts widget coordinates to canvas coordinates
- Accounts for zoom and pan transformations
- Handles different screen sizes and orientations
- Calculates piece center positions accurately

### State Management
- Reactive providers using Riverpod
- Automatic persistence to SharedPreferences
- Real-time UI updates without app restart
- Error handling and loading states

## User Experience Flow

1. **Settings Configuration**: User adjusts precision slider
2. **Visual Preview**: Immediate description update of difficulty level
3. **Game Play**: Drag piece to puzzle area
4. **Position Validation**: System checks if placement is within tolerance
5. **Success Path**: Piece snaps to correct position, plays success sound
6. **Error Path**: Piece stays where dropped with red outline, plays error sound
7. **Recovery**: User can tap incorrect piece to return it to tray
8. **Completion**: Only correctly placed pieces count toward puzzle completion

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Default precision (0.0) maintains current "drop anywhere" behavior
- ✅ Existing save files continue to work
- ✅ Legacy placement methods still function
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing code
- ✅ Progressive enhancement approach

## Testing

- ✅ Unit tests for precision calculations
- ✅ Settings service validation
- ✅ Enum and class structure verification
- ✅ Edge case handling (out of range values)

## Performance Considerations

- ✅ Minimal impact on drag operations
- ✅ Efficient coordinate calculations
- ✅ Cached position calculations
- ✅ Optimized rendering for incorrect pieces
- ✅ No memory leaks in state management

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Visual tolerance preview**: Show tolerance zones during drag
2. **Animated corrections**: Smooth piece movement to correct position
3. **Difficulty presets**: Quick settings for common precision levels
4. **Achievement system**: Rewards for completing puzzles at high precision
5. **Accessibility**: Voice feedback for piece placement

### Advanced Features
1. **Adaptive difficulty**: Automatically adjust precision based on player performance
2. **Time pressure**: Reduce tolerance zones as time progresses
3. **Hint system**: Visual indicators for correct placement areas
4. **Tutorial mode**: Guided introduction to precision mechanics

## Success Metrics

✅ **Implementation Complete**: All core features working as designed
✅ **User Experience**: Smooth transition from easy to hard precision
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of correct/incorrect placements
✅ **Performance**: No degradation during drag operations
✅ **Accessibility**: Supports users with different motor skills
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved

## Documentation

- ✅ Architecture decision documented
- ✅ Implementation plan created
- ✅ Code extensively commented
- ✅ User interface clearly labeled
- ✅ Test coverage provided

This implementation successfully addresses the original request to add a difficulty dial for piece placement precision, transforming the puzzle game from "too easy" drop-anywhere mechanics to a challenging, skill-based placement system with multiple difficulty levels and comprehensive user feedback.
