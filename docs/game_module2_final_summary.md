# Game Module 2 - Implementation Complete

## Executive Summary

`game_module2` is now fully implemented as a drop-in replacement for the original `game_module`. It solves the critical piece placement issue where pieces would auto-snap regardless of drop position, and provides a clean hexagonal architecture for future development.

## What Was Built

### Core Problem Solved
**Original Issue**: The entire puzzle canvas was a single drop zone, causing pieces to automatically snap to their correct positions no matter where they were dropped, making the puzzle trivially easy.

**Solution**: Individual drop targets for each grid cell that only accept the correct piece, requiring precise placement for a real puzzle-solving challenge.

## How to Switch

### One-Line Change
In `lib/core/infrastructure/service_locator.dart`:

```dart
// Change from:
serviceLocator.registerSingleton<GameModule>(PuzzleGameModule());

// To:
serviceLocator.registerSingleton<GameModule>(PuzzleGameModule2());
```

That's it! The module is designed to be fully compatible with the existing app.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Proper Piece Placement
- Pieces only snap when dropped on their correct grid cell
- Visual feedback (green highlight) shows valid drop zones
- Grid lines help users identify piece boundaries
- Proximity-based haptic feedback as pieces approach correct positions

### 2. Workspace Model
- Pieces can float freely on the workspace
- Multiple pieces can be moved around before placement
- Drag pieces from tray or reposition workspace pieces
- Clear visual distinction between tray/workspace/placed states

### 3. Clean Architecture
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic, no Flutter dependencies
- **Application Layer**: Use case orchestration
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Platform-specific implementations
- **Presentation Layer**: UI components

### 4. Consistent Coordinate System
- All internal coordinates in pixel units (e.g., 2048x2048)
- No confusion between grid/canvas/screen coordinates
- Zoom is purely a viewport transformation
- Clear transformation boundaries between layers

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Created comprehensive domain tests in `test/game_module2/domain_test.dart`:
- Piece movement and snapping logic
- Proximity feedback calculations
- Workspace state management
- Score calculation
- Serialization/deserialization

Run tests:
```bash
flutter test test/game_module2/domain_test.dart
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start the app with new module
2. Drag a piece from the tray
3. Try dropping in wrong position → Won't snap
4. Drop on correct grid cell → Snaps with haptic feedback
5. Verify grid lines visible
6. Complete puzzle → Completion dialog appears

## Benefits Over Original

| Aspect | game_module | game_module2 |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Piece Placement** | Auto-snaps anywhere | Only snaps at correct position |
| **Challenge Level** | Too easy | Proper puzzle difficulty |
| **Architecture** | Mixed concerns | Clean hexagonal architecture |
| **Testability** | Limited | Full domain testing |
| **Coordinates** | Confusing mix | Unified pixel coordinates |
| **Feedback** | Basic | Proximity-based haptic |
| **Future Features** | Hard to add | Easy to extend |

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Test the switch in your development environment
2. Verify piece placement works correctly
3. Check performance on target devices

### Short Term
1. Remove old game_module code after verification
2. Update integration tests
3. Add feature flags for A/B testing

### Future Enhancements (Now Easy to Add)
1. **Piece Rotation** - Add rotation state and gestures
2. **Edge Snapping** - Connect adjacent pieces automatically
3. **Multi-Select** - Move groups of pieces together
4. **Undo/Redo** - Command pattern for move history
5. **Difficulty Modes** - Timer, no grid lines, rotation required

## Conclusion

The `game_module2` implementation is complete and ready for integration. It fixes the critical drop zone issue that made puzzles too easy, provides a proper challenge with precise piece placement, and establishes a clean architecture for future development.

The module is a drop-in replacement requiring only a single line change to activate. All existing features are maintained while adding proper piece placement mechanics and improved user feedback.

The hexagonal architecture ensures the code is maintainable, testable, and extensible for future enhancements.
