# Pixel-Perfect Positioning Implementation

**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Decision Makers**: Daniel (Platform Developer)

## Problem Statement

The enhanced puzzle rendering system successfully removed transparent padding from puzzle pieces, but the main puzzle grid was still using a uniform GridView layout that didn't respect the original pixel specifications from the asset images. This resulted in pieces being incorrectly sized and positioned when placed in the grid, despite having the correct cropped content.

The core issue was that jigsaw puzzle pieces have:
1. **Irregular shapes** - Content within each bounding box is positioned differently
2. **Original positioning data** - Each piece has specific pixel coordinates where it should be placed
3. **Varying content bounds** - The actual piece content varies in size and position within the bounding box

## Solution Overview

Implemented a pixel-perfect positioning system that:

1. **Tracks original locations** - Each piece stores its exact grid position in pixel coordinates
2. **Uses Stack + Positioned layout** - Replaces GridView with precise positioning
3. **Calculates content offsets** - Combines original location with content bounds for accurate placement
4. **Maintains proper scaling** - Scales the entire puzzle proportionally while preserving exact positioning

## Architecture Changes

### Enhanced PieceBounds Class

Extended `PieceBounds` to include original location information:

```dart
class PieceBounds {
  final Size originalSize;
  final Rect contentRect;
  final bool hasContent;
  final Offset originalLocation;     // NEW: Where piece should be positioned in puzzle
  
  // Helper methods for positioning calculations
  Offset getContentOffset() {
    return Offset(
      originalLocation.dx + contentRect.left,
      originalLocation.dy + contentRect.top,
    );
  }
  
  Size getContentSize() {
    return contentRect.size;
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Asset Manager Updates

Modified piece processing to calculate and store original locations:

```dart
Future<void> _loadAndProcessSinglePieceImage(String pieceId, String assetPath) async {
  // Parse piece coordinates from piece ID
  final coords = pieceId.split('_');
  final row = int.parse(coords[0]);
  final col = int.parse(coords[1]);
  
  // Calculate original location in the puzzle grid
  final originalLocation = Offset(
    col * originalImage.width.toDouble(),
    row * originalImage.height.toDouble(),
  );
  
  // Process with location information
  final processingResult = await _processPieceImage(originalImage, pieceId, originalLocation);
}
```

### Puzzle Grid Layout Overhaul

Replaced GridView with Stack-based positioning in `_buildPuzzleGrid()`:

```dart
Widget _buildPuzzleGrid() {
  return LayoutBuilder(
    builder: (context, constraints) {
      final puzzleDimensions = _calculateOriginalPuzzleDimensions();
      final scale = _calculateGridScale(constraints.size, puzzleDimensions);
      
      return Container(
        child: SizedBox(
          width: puzzleDimensions.width * scale,
          height: puzzleDimensions.height * scale,
          child: Stack(
            children: [
              // Positioned pieces using exact pixel coordinates
              ..._buildPositionedPieces(scale),
              // Drag targets using original bounding boxes
              ..._buildDragTargets(scale),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      );
    },
  );
}
```

### Precise Piece Positioning

Each placed piece is positioned using calculated content offsets:

```dart
List<Widget> _buildPositionedPieces(double scale) {
  final List<Widget> positionedPieces = [];
  
  for (final piece in placedPieces) {
    final bounds = piece.enhancedAssetManager.getPieceBounds(piece.id);
    if (bounds != null && bounds.hasContent) {
      // Use exact content positioning
      final contentOffset = bounds.getContentOffset();
      final contentSize = bounds.getContentSize();
      
      positionedPieces.add(
        Positioned(
          left: contentOffset.dx * scale,
          top: contentOffset.dy * scale,
          width: contentSize.width * scale,
          height: contentSize.height * scale,
          child: EnhancedCachedPuzzleImage(/* piece content */),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
  
  return positionedPieces;
}
```

### Accurate Drag Targets

Drop targets use the full original bounding box for easier piece placement:

```dart
List<Widget> _buildDragTargets(double scale) {
  // For each empty position, create a drop target using
  // the original piece bounding box dimensions
  final targetLocation = bounds.originalLocation;
  final targetSize = bounds.originalSize;
  
  return Positioned(
    left: targetLocation.dx * scale,
    top: targetLocation.dy * scale,
    width: targetSize.width * scale,
    height: targetSize.height * scale,
    child: DragTarget<PuzzlePiece>(/* drop logic */),
  );
}
```

## Implementation Benefits

### Pixel-Perfect Accuracy
- **Exact positioning**: Pieces are placed precisely where they should be according to original asset specifications
- **Proper scaling**: The entire puzzle scales proportionally while maintaining exact relative positioning
- **Content alignment**: Irregular piece shapes are positioned correctly within their bounding areas

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Visual consistency**: Pieces fit together perfectly as intended by the original puzzle design
- **Intuitive drag targets**: Drop areas use the full piece bounding box for easier placement
- **Zoom compatibility**: Works seamlessly with existing zoom functionality

### Technical Robustness
- **Asset-driven**: Positioning is calculated from actual asset dimensions, not hardcoded values
- **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation if bounds information is unavailable
- **Debug support**: Optional debug visualization shows piece positions and grid coordinates

## Performance Considerations

### Layout Efficiency
- **Stack positioning**: More efficient than GridView for irregular layouts
- **Calculated dimensions**: Puzzle size calculated once per rebuild
- **Minimal widget tree**: Only creates widgets for placed pieces and empty targets

### Memory Management
- **Shared bounds data**: PieceBounds objects reused for positioning calculations

- **Efficient scaling**: Single scale factor applied to all positioning calculations

### Rendering Performance
- **Hardware acceleration**: Leverages Flutter's optimized Stack and Positioned widgets
- **Minimal repaints**: Only affected pieces redraw when positions change
- **Zoom integration**: Scales with existing InteractiveViewer without additional overhead

## Migration and Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility
- **Fallback behavior**: Falls back to default dimensions if bounds unavailable
- **Existing APIs**: No changes to public interfaces of game session or piece classes
- **Asset compatibility**: Works with existing puzzle asset format

### Testing Strategy
- **Positioning accuracy**: Verify pieces place at exact calculated coordinates
- **Scale consistency**: Test proper scaling across different zoom levels and screen sizes
- **Bounds validation**: Ensure all pieces have valid bounds information
- **Performance testing**: Measure layout performance vs. previous GridView approach

## Debug Features

    style: TextStyle(
      color: Colors.grey[400],
      fontSize: 8 * scale,
    ),
  ),
