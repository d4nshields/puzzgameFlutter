# Feature Flag System - CORRECTED & IMPROVED

## 🎯 Overview

This feature flag system now correctly handles the sample puzzle and uses **clear YAML-based configuration** with proper naming:

- **Internal Build**: Sample puzzle **ENABLED** for development and testing
- **External Build**: Sample puzzle **DISABLED** (not ready for users)

## ✅ **CORRECTED BEHAVIOR:**

### Your Original Requirements:
> "The game mechanics of the sample puzzle are being actively developed and are not ready to be shown externally"

### Fixed Implementation:
- **Internal builds**: Sample puzzle **ENABLED** (for development/testing)
- **External builds**: Sample puzzle **DISABLED** (users skip to early access registration)

## 🎯 YAML-Based Configuration

Configuration is now managed through clear YAML files:

- `config/internal.yaml` - Development features
- `config/external.yaml` - Production features

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup (First Time)
```bash
# Make scripts executable and test setup
chmod +x setup_feature_flags.sh
./setup_feature_flags.sh

# Get dependencies (YAML package added)
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Switch Configuration
```bash
# For development (sample puzzle enabled)
./switch_config.sh internal
flutter run

# For production (sample puzzle disabled)
./switch_config.sh external
flutter run
```

### 3. Build Different Variants
```bash
# Development build (sample puzzle enabled)
./build.sh internal debug apk

# Production build (sample puzzle disabled)
./build.sh external release aab
```

### 4. Check Current Configuration
```bash
./switch_config.sh
```

## 🔧 Clear Feature Naming

No more confusing "skip" terminology! Features are now clearly named:

```dart
// BEFORE (confusing):
Features.skipSamplePuzzle  // true = skip, false = show ❌

// AFTER (clear):
Features.samplePuzzle      // true = enabled, false = disabled ✅
Features.googleSignIn      // true = enabled, false = disabled ✅
Features.debugTools        // true = enabled, false = disabled ✅
```

## 📊 Feature Configuration Matrix

| Feature | Internal | External | Purpose |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| **samplePuzzle** | ✅ **ENABLED** | ❌ **DISABLED** | **Under development - only for internal testing** |
| googleSignIn | ✅ ENABLED | ✅ ENABLED | Google authentication |
| earlyAccessRegistration | ✅ ENABLED | ✅ ENABLED | User registration |
| sharingFlow | ✅ ENABLED | ✅ ENABLED | Social features |
| debugTools | ✅ ENABLED | ❌ DISABLED | Development tools |
| experimentalFeatures | ✅ ENABLED | ❌ DISABLED | Unstable features |

## 🎮 Navigation Flow

### Internal Build (Development):
```
App Launch → Sample Puzzle (ENABLED) → Early Access Registration → Sharing
```

### External Build (Production):
```
App Launch → Early Access Registration (Sample Puzzle SKIPPED) → Sharing
```

## ⚙️ YAML Configuration Files

### `config/internal.yaml`:
```yaml
features:
  sample_puzzle: true          # ENABLED for development
  debug_tools: true            # Development tools
  experimental_features: true  # All experimental features
  
navigation:
  initial_route: sample_puzzle  # Start with sample puzzle
```

### `config/external.yaml`:
```yaml
features:
  sample_puzzle: false         # DISABLED - not ready for users
  debug_tools: false           # Clean production experience
  experimental_features: false # Only stable features
  
navigation:
  initial_route: early_access_registration  # Skip sample puzzle
```

## 🔧 Adding New Features

1. **Add to YAML files**:
```yaml
# config/internal.yaml
features:
  my_new_feature: true    # Enable for development

# config/external.yaml  
features:
  my_new_feature: false   # Disable for production
```

2. **Add to Dart code**:
```dart
// In build_config.dart
static const bool myNewFeature = _config.features['my_new_feature'] ?? false;
```

3. **Use in your app**:
```dart
if (Features.myNewFeature) {
  // Feature implementation
}

// Or with widgets
FeatureGate(
  feature: Features.myNewFeature,
  child: MyNewFeatureWidget(),
  fallback: Text('Feature not available'),
)
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

```bash
# Test internal build (sample puzzle should be enabled)
./switch_config.sh internal
flutter run
# Should show sample puzzle in development

# Test external build (sample puzzle should be disabled)
./switch_config.sh external
flutter run
# Should skip sample puzzle, go to early access
```

## 📱 Current Configuration Status

The system is currently set to **external** build (production mode). 

**This means**:
- ✅ Sample puzzle is **DISABLED** (correct for production)
- ✅ Users will skip sample puzzle and go to early access registration
- ✅ No debug tools or experimental features

**To enable sample puzzle for development**:
```bash
./switch_config.sh internal
```

## 🎯 Key Improvements Made

1. **✅ Fixed Logic**: Sample puzzle now correctly disabled in external builds
2. **✅ Clear Naming**: No more confusing "skip" terminology
3. **✅ YAML Config**: Easy-to-read configuration files
4. **✅ Proper Navigation**: Routes determined by navigation configuration
5. **✅ Better Documentation**: Clear explanations of what each feature does

## 🔍 Verification

**To verify the fix works correctly**:

1. **Check external build** (current): `./switch_config.sh` should show sample puzzle DISABLED
2. **Switch to internal**: `./switch_config.sh internal` - sample puzzle becomes ENABLED  
3. **Switch back to external**: `./switch_config.sh external` - sample puzzle becomes DISABLED again

**The sample puzzle is now correctly**:
- **ENABLED** in internal builds (for your development)
- **DISABLED** in external builds (hidden from users)

## 🚀 Ready to Use!

The feature flag system now works exactly as you requested:
- Sample puzzle is only shown in internal builds for development
- External builds skip the sample puzzle since it's not ready for users
- Clear, readable YAML configuration
- No more confusing "skip" naming
