# Zoom Service Architecture Decision

**Date**: June 7, 2025  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Decision Makers**: Daniel (Platform Developer)

## Context

The puzzle game requires zoom functionality with the following requirements:
- Vertical thumb-wheel control on the edge for zoom control
- Single-finger pan support on the main viewport
- Synchronized scaling between main viewport and piece tray
- Support for various screen sizes and orientations
- Smooth but performant operation on Android 13-16

We want to implement zoom functionality while keeping the implementation flexible for future enhancements.

## Decision

We implemented an interface-based zoom service that manages zoom state and provides notifications to UI components.

### Interface Design
```dart
abstract class ZoomService extends ChangeNotifier {
  double get zoomLevel;
  double get minZoom;
  double get maxZoom;
  Offset get panOffset;
  
  void setZoom(double zoom);
  void adjustZoom(double delta);
  void setPanOffset(Offset offset);
  void reset();
  void fitToViewport({required Size contentSize, required Size viewportSize});
}
```

### Implementation
- **DefaultZoomService**: Provides zoom range 0.5x to 3.0x with 0.1x steps
- **ZoomControl Widget**: Vertical slider with +/- buttons and reset
- **InteractiveViewer Integration**: Hardware-accelerated zoom and pan

## Rationale

1. **Interface Flexibility**: Zoom behavior can be enhanced without changing dependent code
2. **State Management**: Centralized zoom state with change notifications
3. **Performance**: Uses Flutter's built-in InteractiveViewer for hardware acceleration
4. **Synchronization**: Single source of truth for zoom level across all UI components
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive vertical thumb-wheel as requested

## Technical Implementation

### Zoom Control
- Positioned on right edge of main viewport
- Vertical slider rotated -90 degrees
- +/- buttons for incremental adjustment
- Reset button to return to 100% zoom
- Semi-transparent background for visibility

### Viewport Integration
- InteractiveViewer wraps the puzzle grid
- TransformationController syncs with ZoomService
- Bidirectional sync between InteractiveViewer and ZoomService
- Pan gestures handled by InteractiveViewer

### Tray Synchronization
- Piece size scales with zoom level: `baseSize * zoomLevel`
- Grid layout adjusts dynamically based on available space
- Maintains usability across zoom range

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Smooth zoom and pan experience
- ✅ Hardware acceleration for good performance
- ✅ Synchronized scaling across all UI elements
- ✅ Intuitive thumb-wheel control as requested
- ✅ Supports various screen sizes automatically
- ✅ Easy to extend with additional zoom features

### Negative
- ⚠️ Basic zoom bounds (0.5x-3.0x) may need adjustment based on usage
- ⚠️ No smart zoom features yet (auto-fit pieces, etc.)
- ⚠️ InteractiveViewer sync could be enhanced

## Performance Considerations

- InteractiveViewer provides hardware-accelerated transformations
- Piece tray rebuilds efficiently with dynamic grid calculations
- Change notifications are throttled by Flutter's ChangeNotifier
- Memory usage remains constant across zoom levels

## Future Enhancements

When ready to enhance zoom functionality:
1. Add smart zoom presets (fit puzzle, fit piece, etc.)
2. Implement zoom gesture recognition (pinch-to-zoom)
3. Add mini-map for navigation on large puzzles
4. Zoom animation and easing
5. Zoom-specific piece filtering/organization

## Implementation Files

- `lib/core/domain/services/zoom_service.dart` - Interface and default implementation
- `lib/game_module/widgets/zoom_control.dart` - Zoom control UI widget
- `lib/game_module/widgets/enhanced_puzzle_game_widget.dart` - Integration with game

## Testing Strategy

- Zoom level boundary testing (to be implemented)
- Pan offset management verification
- Change notification testing
- UI widget interaction tests
- Integration tests with game mechanics
- Performance testing on various screen sizes
