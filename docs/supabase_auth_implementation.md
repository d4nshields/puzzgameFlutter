# Supabase Authentication Implementation Summary

## What was added:

### 1. Dependencies (pubspec.yaml)
- `supabase_flutter: ^2.8.1` - Supabase SDK for Flutter
- `google_sign_in: ^6.2.2` - Google Sign-In support

### 2. Core Infrastructure

#### Supabase Configuration
- `/lib/core/infrastructure/supabase/supabase_config.dart` - Initializes Supabase with your project URL and anon key

#### Authentication Service
- `/lib/core/domain/services/auth_service.dart` - Abstract interface for authentication
- `/lib/core/infrastructure/supabase/supabase_auth_service.dart` - Supabase implementation with Google Sign-In

#### User Entity
- `/lib/core/domain/entities/user.dart` - User data model using Freezed

### 3. UI Components

#### Sign-In Screen
- `/lib/presentation/screens/sign_in_screen.dart` - Minimal sign-in screen with Google button
- Option to continue without signing in

#### User Profile Widget
- `/lib/presentation/widgets/user_profile_widget.dart` - Shows signed-in user info and sign-out button

#### Updated Screens
- **Home Screen**: Shows sign-in button or user avatar in app bar
- **Settings Screen**: Displays user profile at the top

### 4. Android Configuration
- Updated `settings.gradle.kts` and `app/build.gradle.kts` for Google services
- Created placeholder `google-services.json` with instructions

## Next Steps:

1. **Configure Google Sign-In in Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Enable Google provider in Authentication settings
   - Add your Android package name and SHA-1 fingerprint

2. **Set up Firebase**:
   - Create Firebase project
   - Download real `google-services.json`
   - Replace the placeholder file

3. **Run code generation** for Freezed classes:
   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

4. **Test the flow**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## How it works:

1. Users tap the account icon in the home screen app bar
2. They're taken to a minimal sign-in screen with Google Sign-In
3. After signing in, user data is stored in Supabase
4. User info appears in settings and home screen
5. All game data can now be associated with the authenticated user

The implementation is minimal and focuses on:
- Low friction signup (Google only)
- Clean, simple UI
- Offline play still possible (skip sign-in option)
- Ready for cross-game user tracking in your "core" Supabase project
