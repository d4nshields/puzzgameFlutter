# Text & Subtext

 - Deep Slate (#3B3A36) → Primary Text

- Stone Gray (#6C6862) → Secondary Text

 - Sea Pebble (#9DA6A0) → Tertiary Text / Status Indicators

# Interactive Elements & Highlights

 - Golden Sandbar (#DDBF7A) → Primary Buttons & Highlights

	- “Start Puzzle,” “Next,” or key call-to-action buttons.

	- Use for progress bars or active toggle states.

	- Pair with Deep Slate text for legibility.

 - Seafoam Mist (#A9C8BC) → Secondary Buttons / Positive Indicators

	- Great for “Save,” “Relax Mode,” or subtle positive feedback.

	- Could be hover states or accent borders for focusable elements.

 - Coral Blush (#E79D83) → Alerts & Friendly Highlights

	- Use sparingly for “New Puzzle,” notifications, or celebratory UI moments.

	- Also works as a hover highlight on neutral buttons for a warm pop.

# Optional Accent Strategy
 - Consider using Seafoam Mist for hover/focus outlines or selection highlights, since it’s calming and universally pleasant.

 - Keep Coral Blush and Golden Sandbar limited to active, clickable, or special moments so the app feels calm rather than busy.
