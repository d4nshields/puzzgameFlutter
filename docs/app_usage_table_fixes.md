# app_usage Table Schema Fixes - Summary

## Date: July 26, 2025

## Problem Identified
The `app_usage` table had the same relationship visibility issues as `user_events`:

- ‚ùå **Missing foreign key constraint** for `session_id` 
- ‚ùå **Data type mismatch**: `session_id` was TEXT, not UUID
- ‚ùå **No relationship lines** in Supabase schema visualizer
- ‚ùå **Missing performance indexes** for session-related queries

## Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ **1. Fixed Data Type:**
```sql
-- Changed session_id from TEXT to UUID
ALTER TABLE app_usage 
ALTER COLUMN session_id TYPE UUID USING session_id::UUID;
```

### ‚úÖ **2. Added Foreign Key Constraint:**
```sql
-- Linked session_id to game_sessions table
ALTER TABLE app_usage 
ADD CONSTRAINT app_usage_session_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES public.game_sessions(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

### ‚úÖ **3. Added Performance Indexes:**
```sql
-- Session-related indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_app_usage_session_id ON app_usage(session_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_app_usage_user_session ON app_usage(user_id, session_id);

-- Query optimization indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_app_usage_action ON app_usage(action);
CREATE INDEX idx_app_usage_timestamp ON app_usage(timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_app_usage_action_timestamp ON app_usage(action, timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_app_usage_user_action ON app_usage(user_id, action);
```

## Data Safety Verification

‚úÖ **No data loss**: All existing 61 rows preserved  
‚úÖ **Safe conversion**: All `session_id` values were NULL, so no conversion issues  
‚úÖ **Existing constraints**: `user_id` foreign key already existed and was preserved  

## Results in Schema Visualizer

### **Before:**
- `app_usage` table appeared disconnected
- No relationship lines visible
- Looked like an orphaned table

### **After:** 
- ‚úÖ `app_usage.user_id` ‚Üí `auth.users.id` (relationship line visible)
- ‚úÖ `app_usage.session_id` ‚Üí `game_sessions.id` (relationship line visible)
- ‚úÖ Clear visual connections in schema diagram

## Query Performance Benefits

### **Faster Analytics Queries:**
```sql
-- ‚úÖ Optimized: User activity analysis
SELECT u.email, a.action, a.timestamp, gs.puzzle_id
FROM app_usage a
JOIN auth.users u ON a.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN game_sessions gs ON a.session_id = gs.id
WHERE a.user_id = $1;

-- ‚úÖ Optimized: Session-specific usage
SELECT action, timestamp, usage_data
FROM app_usage 
WHERE session_id = $1
ORDER BY timestamp;

-- ‚úÖ Optimized: Action frequency analysis
SELECT action, COUNT(*), DATE(timestamp) as date
FROM app_usage
WHERE action = 'game_started'
GROUP BY action, DATE(timestamp);
```

### **Index Performance:**
- `idx_app_usage_user_id` - Fast user lookups
- `idx_app_usage_session_id` - Fast session lookups  
- `idx_app_usage_user_session` - Fast user+session combinations
- `idx_app_usage_action_timestamp` - Fast action analytics over time

## Complete Schema Health

### **All Tables Now Properly Connected:**
1. ‚úÖ **user_events** - Fully connected with FK constraints and indexes
2. ‚úÖ **app_usage** - Fully connected with FK constraints and indexes  
3. ‚úÖ **user_achievements** - Existing connections preserved
4. ‚úÖ **game_sessions** - Central hub for session-related data
5. ‚úÖ **users** - Proper user data relationships

### **Schema Visualizer Status:**
üéâ **All relationship lines now render correctly!**

The Supabase schema visualizer should now show a complete, connected database schema with all tables properly linked through foreign key relationships.

## Verification Commands

```sql
-- Check app_usage foreign keys
SELECT conname, confrelid::regclass as foreign_table
FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE conrelid = 'app_usage'::regclass AND contype = 'f';

-- Check app_usage indexes  
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'app_usage';

-- Test relationship query
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM app_usage a
JOIN game_sessions gs ON a.session_id = gs.id;
```

Both `user_events` and `app_usage` tables are now fully integrated into your database schema with proper relationships, constraints, and performance optimizations! üéâ
