# Required Graphics for Google Play Store

To publish your app on the Google Play Store, you'll need to prepare the following graphics assets:

## Required Assets

### App Icon
- ✅ **App Icon (512x512)** - You already have this at `/home/daniel/puzzgameFlutter/assets/app_icon-512.png`
- This will be generated in various sizes during the build process

### Feature Graphic (Required)
- ❌ **Feature Graphic (1024x500)** - This appears at the top of your app listing
- Must be created to match your app's branding
- Should not contain the app icon (it's displayed separately)
- Avoid text if possible (it may be cropped on different devices)

### Screenshots (Required)
- ❌ **Phone Screenshots** (Minimum 2, Maximum 8)
- Recommended minimum: 4 screenshots showing different aspects of the app
- Dimensions: 16:9 aspect ratio (e.g., 1920x1080)
- These are vital for convincing users to install your app

### Promo Video (Optional but Recommended)
- ❌ **Promo Video** - YouTube video URL
- 30-120 seconds showing app functionality
- Greatly increases conversion rate

## How to Create These Assets

### Feature Graphic
- Use graphic design software like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or Canva
- Use a template size of 1024x500 pixels
- Showcase your app's theme or main gameplay element
- Keep it simple and visually appealing

### Screenshots
- Take actual screenshots from your app using Android's screenshot functionality
- Or create "frameless" screenshots using Android Studio's "Take Screenshot" feature
- Consider adding captions or frames to highlight features
- Ensure consistent styling across all screenshots

## Notes for Alpha Release

For an alpha release, the most critical items are:
1. App Icon (which you already have)
2. Feature Graphic
3. At least 2 screenshots

The quality of these assets directly impacts user perception, so invest time in creating polished graphics even for an alpha release.
