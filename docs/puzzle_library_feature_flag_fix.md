# Feature Flag Fix: Puzzle Library Teaser\n\n## Issue\nPuzzle Library was incorrectly gated behind `Features.experimentalFeatures` which is disabled in external builds. This prevented external users from accessing the puzzle library teaser, which defeats its marketing purpose.\n\n## Root Cause\nThe puzzle library teaser is specifically designed as a marketing tool to:\n1. Show external users what puzzles will be available\n2. Encourage early access registration\n3. Build excitement for the full version\n\nGating it behind experimental features was counterproductive.\n\n## Solution\nCreated a dedicated feature flag `Features.puzzleLibraryTeaser` that is:\n- **Internal builds**: `true` (for testing)\n- **External builds**: `true` (for marketing)\n\nThis ensures the puzzle library is always available to external users as intended.\n\n## Files Modified\n1. **lib/core/configuration/build_config.dart**\n   - Added `Features.puzzleLibraryTeaser = true`\n   - Updated feature summary to include new flag\n\n2. **lib/main.dart**\n   - Changed route gating from `Features.experimentalFeatures` to `Features.puzzleLibraryTeaser`\n\n## Result\n✅ External users can now access puzzle library teaser\n✅ Feature can still be toggled if needed\n✅ Maintains architectural consistency with other features\n
