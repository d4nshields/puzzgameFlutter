# Bug Fix: Difficulty Settings Now Control Puzzle Grid Size

## What was fixed:
- **Issue**: Puzzle was always showing a 16x16 grid regardless of difficulty setting
- **Solution**: Integrated settings service with puzzle game module to use correct grid sizes

## Changes made:

### 1. Created Settings Service
- Added `SettingsService` interface and implementation using SharedPreferences
- Defines grid sizes: Easy (8x8), Medium (12x12), Hard (16x16)
- Provides persistent storage for user preferences

### 2. Updated Settings Screen
- Now loads and saves settings from persistent storage
- Shows piece count for each difficulty level
- Better user experience with loading states

### 3. Updated Game Screen
- Now reads difficulty from settings when starting a game
- Uses user's preferred difficulty instead of hardcoded medium

### 4. Updated Puzzle Game Module
- Removed hardcoded grid size mapping
- Now uses SettingsService to get consistent grid sizes
- Removed Equatable inheritance to fix immutability warnings

### 5. Added Dependencies
- Added `shared_preferences` for persistent settings storage
- Updated service locator to include settings service

## Testing the fix:
1. Go to Settings and change difficulty
2. Start a new game
3. Verify the puzzle grid matches the selected difficulty:
   - Easy: 8x8 grid (64 pieces)
   - Medium: 12x12 grid (144 pieces)  
   - Hard: 16x16 grid (256 pieces)

The settings now persist between app sessions and correctly control the puzzle complexity!
