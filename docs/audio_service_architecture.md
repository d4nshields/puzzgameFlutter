# Audio Service Architecture Decision

**Date**: June 7, 2025  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Decision Makers**: Daniel (Platform Developer)

## Context

The puzzle game requires audio feedback for user interactions to enhance the gaming experience. We need to provide sound effects for:
- Correct piece placement
- Incorrect piece placement attempts
- Puzzle completion celebration
- UI interactions (button clicks, piece selection)

However, we want to defer the decision about which audio library to use while still providing immediate functionality.

## Decision

We implemented an interface-based audio service architecture that allows us to defer specific audio implementation decisions while providing immediate functionality.

### Interface Design
```dart
abstract class AudioService {
  Future<void> initialize();
  Future<void> playPieceCorrect();
  Future<void> playPieceIncorrect();
  Future<void> playPuzzleCompleted();
  Future<void> playPieceSelected();
  Future<void> playUIClick();
  Future<void> setVolume(double volume);
  Future<void> setEnabled(bool enabled);
  Future<void> dispose();
}
```

### Initial Implementation
- **SystemAudioService**: Uses Flutter's built-in `SystemSound` API
- Zero external dependencies
- Handles errors gracefully
- Stores volume/enabled preferences for future implementations

## Rationale

1. **Deferred Decisions**: Interface allows us to change audio implementations later without affecting game logic
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: SystemSound requires no external packages
3. **Platform Compatibility**: Works across all Flutter platforms
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Continues to function even if system sounds are unavailable
5. **Future Flexibility**: Easy to swap for custom audio library when needed

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Immediate audio feedback with zero dependencies
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Easy to test with mocks
- ✅ Ready for future enhancement without breaking changes
- ✅ Handles volume/enabled preferences for future implementations

### Negative
- ⚠️ Limited to system sounds initially (click, alert)
- ⚠️ No volume control with current implementation
- ⚠️ Cannot play custom puzzle-specific sounds yet

## Future Considerations

When we're ready to enhance audio:
1. Add `audioplayers` or `just_audio` package
2. Create `CustomAudioService` implementation
3. Support custom sound files and background music
4. Implement proper volume control
5. Add audio settings to the settings service

## Implementation Files

- `lib/core/domain/services/audio_service.dart` - Interface definition
- `lib/core/infrastructure/system_audio_service.dart` - System sound implementation
- `test/core/domain/services/audio_service_test.dart` - Comprehensive tests

## Testing Strategy

- Interface contract testing with mocks
- System audio service unit tests
- Error handling verification
- Volume/enabled state management tests
- Integration tests with game mechanics
